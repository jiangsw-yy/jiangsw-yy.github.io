abstract: "With the explosive growth of video data in real applications, near-duplicate video retrieval (NDVR) has become indispensable and challenging, especially for short videos. However, all existing NDVR datasets are introduced for long videos. Furthermore, most of them are small-scale and lack of diversity due to the high cost of collecting and labeling near-duplicate videos. In this paper, we introduce a large-scale short video dataset, called SVD, for the NDVR task. SVD contains over 500,000 short videos and over 30,000 labeled videos of near-duplicates. We use multiple video mining techniques to construct positive/negative pairs. Furthermore, we design temporal and spatial transformations to mimic user-attack behavior in real applications for constructing more difficult variants of SVD. Experiments show that existing state-of-the-art NDVR methods, including real-value based and hashing based methods, fail to achieve satisfactory performance on this challenging dataset. The release of SVD dataset will foster research and system engineering in the NDVR area. The SVD dataset is available at https://svdbase.github.io."
