Welcome to my personal homepage! 

My name is Qing-Yuan Jiang (蒋庆远 in Chinese). I am an Associate Professor at <a href="https://cs.njust.edu.cn/" target="_blank">the School of Compute Science and Engineering</a>, <a href="https://www.njust.edu.cn/" target="_blank">Nanjing University of Science and Technology</a>.

I am from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tengchong" _target="_blank">Tengchong (腾冲市)</a>, Yunnan Province. TengChong is a beautiful city in southwest China with many attractions such as Heshun town, the volcanic park (in Mazhan), and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaoligong_Mountains" _target="_blank">Gaoligong Mountain</a>. Tengchong was the site of the Battle of Northern Burma and Western Yunnan during World War II.

In 2010, I was addmitted to <a href="https://www.nju.edu.cn/" _target="_blank">Nanjing University</a>. At Nanjing University, I received my B.Sc degree from <a href="https://cs.nju.edu.cn/" _target="_blank">Department of Computer Science and Technology</a>, Nanjing University in 2014. In 2020, I received my Ph.D degree frm the <a href="https://www.lamda.nju.edu.cn/CH.MainPage.ashx" target="_blan">LAMDA group</a>, Department of Computer Science and Technology, Nanjing University, under the supervision of Professor <a href="https://cs.nju.edu.cn/lwj" target="_blank">Wu-Jun Li</a>. My Ph.D thesis is Discrete Hashing Learning. In 2012, I joined the Communist Party of China as a formal party member.

After graduated from Nanjing University, I was an algorithm researcher at <a href="https://www.huawei.com/cn/" _target="_blank">HuaWei</a> from 2020 to 2024, as a member of Huawei's <a href="https://career.huawei.com/reccampportal/portal5/topminds.html" _target="_blank">top minds project</a>. At Huawei, my work focused on multimodal search (Petal Search) and multimodal large language models (<a href="https://www.huaweicloud.com/product/pangu.html" target="_blank">Pangu MLLM</a>).

In 2024, I joined <a href="https://cs.njust.edu.cn/" target="_blank">the School of Compute Science and Engineering</a>, <a href="https://www.njust.edu.cn/" target="_blank">Nanjing University of Science and Technology</a>, as an associate professor. My research interests are machine learning, data mining, and big data.

After work, I prefer to play basketball. In 2015, I won third place in the Spot Shooting Competition of NJUCS Fun Sports Day. I am also interesting in history.
